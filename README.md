## Preview

This is a basic game of tic tac toe with a restart button, so you can play as many times as you like.

## Technology used:

- Vanilla Javascript, CSS and HTML.
- Canva for wireframe

## Approach:
My approach was to first create my game board, then use DOM manipulation to, interact with my board.
I used higher functions to build my board and to record my game results and store those results in arrays.

### How i solved for the winner:
i saved the entire state of the game in a 2d array, then used loops to check each row if it has the same value then alerting an adding scores.

## Main features:
- Restart Button
- clickable cells
